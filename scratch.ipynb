Licensees holding a valid authorization on August 6, 2015 to operate in this band may continue to operate as authorized, subject to proper license renewal. \t(b) In order to minimize interference to the Earth exploration-satellite service (passive) receiving in this band, licensees of stations in the fixed service are urged to: (1) limit the maximum transmitter power supplied to the antenna to −15 dBW; and (2) employ automatic transmitter power control (ATPC).  The maximum transmitter power supplied to the antenna of stations using ATPC may be increased by a value corresponding to the ATPC range, up to a maximum of −3 dBW.</span></p><p id=\"fcc\"><b>US59:</b>&nbspThe band 10.5-10.55 GHz is restricted to systems using type NON (AO) emission with a power not to exceed 40 watts into the antenna.</span></p><p id=\"fcc\"><b>US74:</b>&nbspIn the bands 25.55-25.67, 73-74.6, 406.1-410, 608-614, 1400-1427, 1660.51670, 26902700, and 4990-5000 MHz, and in the bands 10.68-10.7, 15.35-15.4, 23.6-24.0, 31.3-31.5, 86-92, 100-102, 109.5111.8, 114.25-116, 148.5-151.5, 164-167, 200-209, and 250-252 GHz, the radio astronomy service shall be protected from unwanted emissions only to the extent that such radiation exceeds the level which would be present if the offending station were operating in compliance with the technical standards or criteria applicable to the service in which it operates.
