This limit may be exceeded on the territory of any country whose administration has so agreed.  In order to ensure that the pfd limit at the border of the territory of any other administration is met, the calculations and verification shall be made, taking into account all relevant information, with the mutual agreement of both administrations (the administration responsible for the terrestrial station and the administration responsible for the earth station), with the assistance of the Bureau if so requested.  In case of disagreement, the calculation and verification of the pfd shall be made by the Bureau, taking into account the information referred to above.  Stations of the mobile service in the frequency band 3500-3600 MHz shall not claim more protection from space stations than that provided in Table 21-4 of the Radio Regulations (Edition of 2004).

This identification does not preclude the use of this frequency band by any application of the services to which it is allocated and does not establish priority in the Radio Regulations.  At the stage of coordination the provisions of Nos. 9.17 and 9.18 also apply.  Before an administration brings into use a base or mobile station of an IMT system, it shall seek agreement under No. 9.21 with other administrations and ensure that the power flux-density (pfd) produced at 3 m above ground does not exceed −154.5 dB(W/(m²  4 kHz)) for more than 20% of time at the border of the territory of any other administration.  This limit may be exceeded on the territory of any country whose administration has so agreed.

In case of disagreement, the calculation and verification of the pfd shall be made by the Bureau, taking into account the information referred to above.  Stations of the mobile service, including IMT systems, in the frequency band 3600-3700 MHz shall not claim more protection from space stations than that provided in Table 21-4 of the Radio Regulations (Edition of 2004).
